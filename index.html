She is the most skilled <span class="dark-red">pyrotechnician</span> in Inazuma and is known as the <span class="red-emphasis">"Queen of the Summer Festival."</span></p>
            <p class="text-center alt-font mw80 pd1em bg-red yellow rounded">Yoimiya, who has inherited the mantle of "Naganohara", is able to give people an unparalleled experience with her ever-changing and spectacular fireworks.</p>
            <p class="text-center alt-font mg1em">In addition to being a craftsperson, she is also the "heroic sister" in the eyes of many children. No matter how big the problem is, Yoimiya always has a solution to save the day.

                Be it the illusions of fear or the shadows of cold reality, they will all dissipate under the starlight magic of Yoimiya's fireworks.
            </p>
            

            <p class="text-center alt-font line-top red">The children are not the only ones she helps — as long as one is willing to talk to her about their troubles, she will lend a helping hand, and try her best to help them through the crisis.

                Splendid fireworks, warm starlight and passionate lights all join in a swirling dance in Yoimiya's hands. Her bright smile is always able to inspire fellow travelers and light up the way for them.

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">To Inazumans, fireworks symbolize summer.
                        The various festivals that take place at fixed times feature a rotation of various events, with fireworks being the sole constant.
                        Over a century ago, the Yashiro Commission once organized a dazzling fireworks display with "commemoration" as the theme.
                        The fireworks then were made by the greatest pyrotechnicians in the land, and this was the origin of the Naganohara Fireworks Show. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">In latter days, fireworks would become more common, and the Naganohara Fireworks Show would slowly become an event in which all people would participate.
                        During the Fireworks Show, everyone can light their favorite fireworks, and the owner of the Naganohara Fireworks store will pick an appropriate time to set up a most lavish performance.
                        The year Yoimiya took over, her first fiesta was already jaw-droppingly good.
                        On the night before that Fireworks Show, Kamisato Ayaka enjoined Yoimiya thusly: "Her Excellency will be watching this fireworks display personally. As such, please add Her Excellency's emblem — the Electro Mitsudomoe — into the fireworks repertoire, if you would."
                        "Haha, just wait for it!" Yoimiya replied, agreeing with great confidence.
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">Before the show could begin, Yoimiya ran all about the city, placing thousands of launch tubes in every nook and cranny. At the festival's finale, the blazing fireworks formed a gigantic picture scroll that depicted the city of Inazuma in the skies.
                        Yet Ayaka did not find the critical emblem in any one of these fireworks, and wondered if Yoimiya had made an error in her arrangements.
                        It was only after speaking with Yoimiya that Ayaka discovered that the image of Inazuma in the skies had an "angling" trick added to it.
                        If viewed from the Tenshukaku, the fireworks would form a huge, clear, and orderly image of the Raiden Shogun's house-crest — with some playfully lacy decorations on the side to boot.
                        Of course, how could Yoimiya miss a beat at a fireworks performance? This way, she won the praise of both the people and the Raiden Shogun, and this feast would become a timeless classic deeply rooted in the memories of countless people.
                        With Yoimiya around, the Inazuman summer shall not lack any glorious fireworks — thus was her nickname, "Queen of the Summer Festival," coined.
                    </p>

                <!--Story Part 2-->
                <div class="carousel-item hidden minh500px mw80">
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">Naganohara's fireworks are loved by all, and work in the shop is always in full swing. As such, people often feel that coming up to the door without important matters might hinder the work.
                        However, it's just the opposite with Yoimiya, for chatting is her other great hobby. In fact, if there's no one to talk to, she might actually find it hard to focus.
                        If chatting with the guest is her way of "understanding their mood and way of thinking, such that the best fireworks can be crafted," then going with the flow and sitting down for tea and an idle chat with them after delivering the goods is how Yoimiya rewards herself. Sometimes, if that is not enough, she will make some small-talk with her neighbors on the way, give them some small trinkets, and receive a basket of small treats in return...
                        Yoimiya is always able to strike a balance between listening and speaking in such chats.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">She doesn't repeat herself, doesn't cross boundaries, doesn't come off as indifferent or overly invested. After a talk over tea, everyone leaves in a good mood.
                        Her neighbors are all ordinary folk, and their lives are not exactly full of extraordinary things. Sometimes, the same news will be told by different people over and over, but Yoimiya does not find this upsetting.
                        What she enjoys is the process of talking to others — even if they speak of the same matter, different people will have different viewpoints.
                        After taking over the fireworks shop, Yoimiya's relationships with her neighbors became still more harmonious. Many old folks have taken her for an old acquaintance, and often invite her to their place to sit and recount the festivals of yesteryear. Middle-aged parents will ask Yoimiya to mediate the relationship between themselves and their children and will regale her with the little trivialities of daily family life. The young people treat Yoimiya as a sibling of sorts, volunteering to help her cart heavy fireworks-making materials around, hoping that Yoimiya will get off work faster and take the children out to play.
                        Yoimiya puts it this way: "I believe in the unique power of language. There's nothing that can't be talked through somehow!"
                    </p>
                </div>
            
                <!--Story Part 3-->
                <div class="carousel-item hidden minh500px mw80">
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">Craftsmen seeking perfection are often rigorous and self-disciplined, but Yoimiya is an exception, acting freely and taking unscheduled breaks.
                        Sometimes, she even has to work late into the night when she misses her daytime work due to chatting for too long. But when the sun begins to rise, she will climb up to the heights to see the sunrise with a sense of accomplishment at having finished her work in her heart. Looking out at the hazy amber-gold clouds, Yoimiya often gains new inspiration, imagining all manners of new fireworks in her mind, even as sleep draws near...
                        Her neighbors have often found her sleeping in places like eaves, tree branches, and stopped waterwheels. Sometimes, she even falls down, before blearily watching her sweet dreams and golden stars fade away into the distance.
                        Fortunately, she has never been seriously injured in such incidents, but she has gotten a number of scrapes and cuts, and it was on that account that she learned how to deal with wounds.
                        At some other times, Yoimiya will sleep until midnight, settling all matters with gusto before heading out for a stroll.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"> Perhaps it may turn out to be an impromptu adventure, or perhaps a test of courage. If a friend is interested, she might call upon them. If she wishes to be alone, she will travel in solitude.
                        Living as she pleases gives Yoimiya a sense of freedom. As for others, they may encounter her at any time at all. She enjoys this freedom, often saying that it has made her life very interesting indeed.
                        Of course, she will restrain herself on the eve of celebrations. Mistakes shall not be made during these all-important performances — her "official business."
                    </p>
                </div>
                
              
                 <!--Story Part 4-->
                 <div class="carousel-item hidden minh500px mw80">
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">Apart from selling fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells various intricate knickknacks. This can be said to be Yoimiya's second career.
                        All manner of trinkets adorn the shelves, with some of them being exotic imports from Beidou that were modified and made into highly distinctive handicrafts, and others being practice works created during bursts of Yoimiya's explosive inspiration.
                        From the Scatterbloom Marbles that will blossom when they knock against each other, Leaping Tops that chirp like birds as they spin, the Neon Dragonfly that changes hue as it ascends into the air, and the somewhat-failed Onikabuto Chariot... All these toys are inspired by the little games that the common people play.
                    </p>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">They are not only popular among the children, but are much-loved by adults as well. Even Arataki Itto, the head of the Arataki Gang, comes over to buy her specially-made knickknacks, which he then brings to go challenge the one he has declared his nemesis.
                        Yoimiya's knickknacks are not just toys. With some thought, they can be very useful in one's daily life. The most classic example of this is the Katydid Coil, which is a ring that can contain a variety of flammables and spices. When ignited and hung up in the summer, it can be used to repel mosquitoes.
                        Many people have come to ask Yoimiya for help on account of her excellent craftsmanship. And though she protests, saying, "Hey now, this is a fireworks shop, not an everything shop. Even I can't possibly do it all," she will still try her best to help, even if her earnings for the whole day are only enough to buy a few snacks. She'll enjoy the whole thing, too — everyone in Hanamizaka is her friend, after all.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                 <!--Story Part 5-->
                 <div class="carousel-item hidden minh500px mw80">
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"><q>The rainbows become fireworks, and they my wishes know, my wishes rise into the skies, and through the night they show.</q>This nameless folksong has been around for a long time now. In recent years, it was misconstrued by the children to mean that as long as they brought some shiny trinkets, they could exchange them with Yoimiya for fireworks that belong just to them, and that if they lit those fireworks up, their wish will come true at some point in the future.
                        As such, the children of Hanamizaka set about searching for beautiful little trinkets with this song on their lips, before bringing them to Yoimiya, with expectation eagarly written on their faces.
                       
                        
                    </p>

                    <p class="alt-font indent justify"> Yoimiya was quite troubled by this at first, but after hearing how the children had interpreted that song, she accepted their requests gladly and even added her own spin to the tale: the "rainbows" in the song not only refer to shiny treasures persay. As long as she found them "sufficiently shiny," whether they were colored rocks from the creeks or shell fragments from the beaches, she would take them and make lovely fireworks as per the agreement.
                        Indeed, if they were to bring her expensive things, she might, in turn, say that they are too ordinary, and take the child to look for the owner of those lost goods.
                        But it really did not matter if the treasures were shiny or not. The important part was the conviction the children had that "rainbows" could indeed be exchanged for "fireworks."
                        Though some might take it for naivete, Yoimiya will give her all to protect the lovely wishes that only children can have.
                    </p>
                    <q class="pd1em">The things we believed in and experienced as children become irreplaceable treasures.</q>
                    <p class="alt-font indent justify">
                        The legendary picture books of Inazuma are often filled with the following images: the cute and playful Great Mujina Youkai, the majestic Shiba Warrior, the Origami Nue who appears out of nowhere...
                        Perhaps those who drew demons in such cute forms also had a similar intention to Yoimiya.
                        The children gather around Yoimiya, enjoying a gladsome time even amidst Inazuma's lockdown.
                        Yoimiya's own child-like heart and liveliness never dulls, like fireworks and stars that shimmer and shine in the night sky.</p>

                                    <p><q>Beidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.</q></p>

                                    <p><q>Fireworks are probably the furthest thing from the "eternity" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has "eternity" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.</q></p>

                                    <p><q>Ayaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, "isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?</q></p>

Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?</q></p>

                                    <p><q>As long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know — all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle. It is transient, but Inazuma is eternal, and my mission is to protect Inazuma.</q></p>

Oh, and Naganohara fireworks are just incredible, you should take every chance you get to see them in action. Ah, on that note — here, have a coupon!</q></p>

                                    <p><q> Naganohara fireworks are well worth the wait every year. Word is that she caused quite an uproar among the Tenryou Commission recently by setting off fireworks all over the place. Heh, I'm sure the members of the Kujou Clan must've turned purple with rage... A pity that I couldn't be there to see it for myself.</q></p>
